###  Strategies
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This section covers some of the famous option trading strategies for different market scenarios. It also contains the code to create the strategies in python.

The folder contains the following topics:

[Bull Call Spread](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=57&section_no=4&unit_no=5): A bull call spread strategy is built by going long on call option and simultaneously selling a higher strike call option.

Bear Put Spread: A bear put spread strategy is built by going long on put option and simultaneously selling a lower strike put option.

[Max_Loss.py](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=57&section_no=4&unit_no=8): In this exercise, we calculate the payoff from the bull call spread and find the maximum possible profit that can be realized from it.

Protective Put: A protective put strategy is built by going long on stock and simultaneously buying a put option. The aim of this strategy is to protect from adverse stock movement.

[Covered Call](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/startCourseDetails?cid=57&section_no=4&unit_no=13): A covered call strategy is built by going long on a stock and simultaneously selling a call option on that stock. The strategy is used when the view on the stock is neutral.
